      <h2> About Me </h2> 
      <div class="a"> I found a interest in coding when I saw YouTubers showing how easy it is to switching a Chrome OS to a Linux, Windows, or Mac. Although I practiced coding and was passionate about it I had no idea what I was doing. I later became a Field
    Technician Engineer, I used code to troubleshoot and diagnose problems and then used code that was tought to me by my peers to fix the problem and if that did not work I would dismantle the device go in and replace the the hardware.</div> 
      <div class="a"> In my last job before joinng as a student at Thinkful I worked at a small company called Solari Corp. as a Field Technician Engineer where I learned more knowledge and my love for computer programming grew deeper. I worked with a two more people a day, sometimes the whole crew depending on the size of the work.
  My passion for web developing came from building my own page and practicing and creating it. I want to help others build web pages and make them smile like I smiled when I finished mine. </div>
