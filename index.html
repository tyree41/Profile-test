<h1> Tyree's Profile  </h1>
</header>
  <p> Hi! I'm Tyree </p> 
  <p> I am student at Thinkful, and I'm from Harlem, New York.</p>
  <p> My goal as student developer is to graduate Thinkful and take my career in software engineering further. </p>
  
  <ul>
  <li> Build a career in computer programming </li> 
  <li> Build a App </li>
  <li> Master and one day teach coding </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2> ABout Me </h2>
  <p> In my last job before joinng as a student at Thinkful I worked at a small company called Solari Corp. as a Field Technician Engineer where I learned more knowledge and my loving for computer programming grew deeper. I worked with a two more people a day, sometimes the whole crew depending on the size of the work.
  My passion for web developer came from building my own page and practicing how to create it. I want to help build other peoples web pages and make them smile when I finished mine. </p>
  <p> I found a interest in coding when I saw Youtubers showing how easy it is to switching a Chrome OS to a Linux, Windows, or Mac. Although I practiced coding and was passionate about it I had no idea what I was doing. I later became a Field
    Technician Engineer, I used code to troubleshoot and diagnose problems and then used code that was tought to me by my peers to fix the problem and if that did not work I would dismantle the device go in and replace the the hardware.</p>
